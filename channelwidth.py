""" Channel Width

This module calculates the channel width at nodes located on a Centerline
!!! it assumes that a node is located in the middle of a channel as the channel width is calculated as twice the closest distance to the channel boundaries !!!

    Function to find the closest vertex of polgyon to a POI.
    The closest neighbor is found by taking all vertices of a polygon which are located
    within a distance r from the POI. The distance r is increased step by step (by the kernel_fract)
    untill a point is found. Therefore, the kernel_fract does not affect the result but it is meant
    to optimize the computational time of the procedure.

    Args:
        POI: (Required) 1x2 Numpy Array, tuple or list with x- and y-coordinates of the poin of interest (POI)
        pol: (Required) nx2 numpy array with x- and y-coordinates of the polygon's vertices
        kernel_fract: (Optional) stepsize of the kernel size (% of the total width/height of the polygon). The kernel stepsize is the size to increase the searching circle around POI.
                                 It does not affect the final result is meant to optimize the computational time of the procedure.
